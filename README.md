# SIW_Template

This is a LaTeX template for the Space Imaging Workshop. 

Users are encouraged to utilize the `SIW.cls` file in the `/src/` directory.  See `/src/SIW_Template.tex` for implementation details. 

Designed to compile with LuaLaTeX, but build tests appear to clear just fine with pdfLaTeX.

For bug reports and feature requests, please submit a detailed issue.
